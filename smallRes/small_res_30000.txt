Board and video games are a passion of mine, so if you like them then lets talk.‚Ä† ‚Ä† Development Skills: Python / Django, JavaScript, MERN Stack, HTML / CSS‚Ä† Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman, Chrome Dev Tools, Git / Github Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Software Engineering Immersive Student General Assembly - San Francisco, CA April 2019 to July 2019 In the Software Engineering Immersive Course I developed several full stack apps.‚Ä† ‚Ä† My third project, Root Rideshare, was a group project that was built on Django, a Python-based web framework. Root Rideshare enabled commuters to easily find rides to and from work during their work week. The feature I am most proud of in this project is integrating both the Google Directions and Static Maps API in conjunction to generate dynamic images (with the path through the streets between point A and B) for the routes that users take to and from work as the routes are created. This feature helps the user visualize exactly how they're getting to their destination.‚Ä† ‚Ä† My second project, Game Journal, was a MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) app where users could write stories about games they've played and have other users comment on their posts. The feature that I am most proud of in this project is the integration of the Giant Bomb API. I used their API to generate reliable info on a game that a user searched. This way, when another user searched the first user's profile looking at the games they played in the past, there would always be reliable information to aid their discovery.

The entire project was written in Python 2.7. https://github.com/dantarion/bbtools‚Ä† ‚Ä† rev2-wakeup-tool creator: rev2-wakeup-tool is a tool that uses the training mode recording/playback feature and input simulation to make the training dummy do whatever the user wants upon standing up from getting knocked down. This added industry standard for fighting games brings Guilty Gear closer to par with games like Street Fighter V, as well as accelerates the competitive community√≠s knowledge of the game. As of 2018, the project no longer uses a high-level, library-based hook, but rather implements a low-level assembly hook that facilitates playback. https://github.com/Labreezy/rev2-wakeup-tool Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge ("TURC"), Dr. Rose Gamble Mentor University of Tulsa - Tulsa, OK June 2015 to December 2018 Applying Machine Learning Techniques and Relational Databases to Real-World Data (2015): I created a two-class support vector machine (√¨SVM√Æ) that predicted collaborative relationships between musicians by examining past collaborations and computed the √¨Bacon√Æ number or degrees of separation between musicians with a relational database. The SVM predicted 81% positive cases correctly in a test sample. (Programs: Python, Azure ML Studio, Java, C++ ) √Ø ‚Ä† ‚Ä† Applying Machine Algorithms to Real-World Data (2016): I used Azure ML Studio to detect anomalies in network traffic. Used Structured Query Language (√¨SQL√Æ) and Python; and co-wrote a research paper submitted and accepted to HICSS-50 (Title: Towards Predicting Secure Environments for Wearable Devices). (Programs: Python, Azure ML Studio, SQL) √Ø ‚Ä† ‚Ä† Truck Network Experiment Editing Frontend/CAN Heavy Vehicle Experiment Editing Frontend (2017-2018): I created a secure website that could successfully transform a Control Area Network (√¨CAN√Æ) exploit into a physical attack on a truck that can be verified with visualizations and real system behavior. After ten weeks, the website became fully integrated with the truck-simulating hardware, and basic visualizations were implemented to verify that the hardware communicated correctly to the front end and outputted useful data. (Programs: Python, Django, SQLite, Javascript) The final portion of this TURC involved implementing new attacks and practical means to execute them through the web front-end, a project expected to yield a scholarly paper. I also worked with packet capture files and replaying traffic to stimulate an actual network, which involved shell scripting (bash) and Python.

Publications Towards Predicting Secure Environments for Wearable Devices http://hdl.handle.net/10125/41321 2016 Wearable devices have become more common for the average consumer. As devices need to operate with low power, many devices use simplified security measures to secure the data during transmission. While Bluetooth, the primary method of communication, includes certain security measures as part of the format, they are insufficient to fully secure the connection and the data transmitted. Users must be made aware of the potential security threats to the information communicated by the wearable, as well as be empowered and engaged to protect it. In this paper, we propose a method of identifying insecure environments through crowdsourced data, allowing wearable consumers to deploy an application on their base system (e.g., a smart phone) that alerts when in the presence of a security threat. We examine two different machine learning methods for classifying the environment and interacting with the users, as well as evaluating the potential uses for both algorithms.‚Ä† √¨Anomaly detection sensors for a Modbus-based oil and gas well-monitoring system√Æ 2019-06 Accepted for presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Data intelligence and Security, June 2019. (Abstract: This paper describes a network sensor that has been specifically designed to operate within an existing well-monitoring infrastructure. Network traffic and flow features are extracted in real-time and compared against pre-set and moving averages to detect and report anomalies. A prototype has been tested using the Modbus protocol and network traffic covering several months of operations. In order to avoid potential impact on the production environment, scripts captured network packets that were then replayed on the IMUNES network emulator. Preliminary results have identified useful metrics for anomaly detection in a production.)

The first MS in Electrical Engineer is National Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taiwan from 2008 to 2011, and GPA is 3.8. Based on the requirement to receive MS degree, I finished the research thesis called √¨Peer-to- Peer Image Retrieval with Multiple Features ~‚Ä†a research project based on the peer-to-peer content-based image retrieval system (P2P-CBIR). It is a proposal for a network image search engine that could not only adapt multiple features of images over multi-instances, but also create a new topology of network used to update the peer linking information between peers to reconfigure P2P-CBIR. The second MS in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Boston from 2015 to 2017, and GPA is 3.8.‚Ä† ‚Ä† ‚àë‚Ä†Working Experiences:‚Ä† My recent working experience is web coordinator at Dauten Family Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. I am responsible for website maintenance, refactoring, and implementation of new features under the direction of the DFC Technical Platform Architect. I created and maintain web surveys, research study related surveys, social/communication features, and other web-related projects. I also test and troubleshoot website features and behavior. This position is primarily back-end PHP programming, but some front-end work. The primarily job is work with Drupal, the framework used by the MoodNetwork web portal and create custom modules using PHP and design database structure for each new custom module. I am responsible for generating custom data exports of participant data, becoming familiar with and adhering to privacy restrictions and requirements. Furthermore, my recent duty is QA. I achieved them by Senelium, SimpleTest(unit test and functional test), manual test in order to check data accuracy, and load testing for network and server√≠s performance. I maintenance and troubleshooting Linux server, and also create own script to update Drupal Core and Linux OS as well as backup database.‚Ä† ‚Ä† To be more details. The one of projects I achieved is called Heathy Heart Healthy You. For this project, I work with Drupal 7, and mainly focus back-end with php, design database with php, data report and testing. Since most of app on MoodNetwork web portal is custom module, I am able to create custom module. For this project, I work with my colleague, Nicha Puvanicha, who is our main developer. I achieved CRUD with drupal layer database, and some advanced query are not using Drupal api. For example, if I have to do subquery or join a couple of tables, I always use db_query() and create my own query syntax. Next, for the database, because we always do custom module, we need tables to store the data. The design is based on the report requirements because this way is to try to reduce join lots of tables. It's also to increase the performance when making data report. Basically, it's to try to reduce loops. Furthermore, I achieved testing and load testing in order to support 8500 people. I used Selenium automated testing for the business logic, positive and negative testing for user behaviors, and SimpleTest for both unit test and functional test. The final is for manual test because of data accuracy. For the load testing, I achieve to accommodate 8000 people to our server. I used JMeter and BlazeMeter. These two app can send multi-thread at the same time or send out a period of time. For this app, our server can have 400 people and send out the request at the same time, and the response time is 3 seconds. Finally, I am also responsible for generating custom data exports of participant data by using R, PHP and Python.‚Ä† ‚Ä† In addition to my former career, my employment as an IT Engineer for different companies has enabled me to utilize my skills in troubleshooting, repairing, updating, and maintaining systems. Whether through formally studying software development and working on various research project, or‚Ä†assisting company owners with resolving any/all IT-related areas of concern that may be affecting their company√≠s ability to achieve its goals and/or run efficiently,‚Ä†I have consistently demonstrated the characteristics and skills required for success in software development:‚Ä†learning something new and upgrading myself‚Ä† ‚Ä† I am interested in exploring opportunities in software development. If you are seeking a lead-by-example team member who can make independent decisions, and be counted on to exceed established goals, you've just found your candidate.‚Ä† ‚Ä† Sincerely,‚Ä† ‚Ä† Kai-Lin Chang‚Ä† enclosure

It√≠s a completely custom flexible framework that can be redesigned into multiple brands‚Ä† quickly while maintaining a central database to keep track of inventory across all future brands. My‚Ä† technology stack of choice for this project was PHP using PDO, JavaScript and Nginx. I chose to use‚Ä† PDO with prepared statements along with UTF-8 character encoding to build a robust and secure system,‚Ä† while protecting against cross site scripting attacks and SQL injection. I√≠m utilizing Ajax for a real time‚Ä† inventory tracking system that was required due to the businesses unique product distribution practices.‚Ä† The cart system utilizes a custom Stripe integration for payment processing. This helps the client keep‚Ä† payment processing information secure and off their personal servers while ensuring PCI compliance. I‚Ä† used Stripe checkout and Stripe PHP libraries to accomplish this.‚Ä† A full administrative panel was required for quick and intuitive business management. This allows the‚Ä† client to manage their stock as well as add and update new products. A notifications database keeps track‚Ä† of customers who want out of stock items. Once the product is back in stock the client can notify all‚Ä† customers with a one click email blast button. SEO tools are also available for instantaneous adaptation to‚Ä† changes in the market.‚Ä† The framework is designed to be swiftly re-branded using HTML and CSS. I worked closely with the‚Ä† system administrator who developed a deployment script so that each time a new brand is launched the‚Ä† deployment will be full automated. Web Developer Halvik Defense Language Institute September 2017 to September 2018 At the Defense Language Institute I worked with the GLOSS team to develop and modernize web based‚Ä† ‚Ä†language learning templates for graduate level Armed Forces training used across all branches of the‚Ä† ‚Ä†military. Working within a custom built framework I created reusable library functions, programmed the‚Ä† ‚Ä†logic for over 20 interactive learning templates, fixed many bugs, and modernized outdated framework‚Ä† ‚Ä†functionality using JavaScript / Jquery, CSS, HTML, and XML.‚Ä† ‚Ä†Working with an aging custom built framework presented a unique set of challenges. The GLOSS‚Ä† ‚Ä†framework was forked from another training program, because of that there was a lot of unnecessary‚Ä† ‚Ä†functionality. First I had to audit the code and document how the framework functioned. I was then able to‚Ä† ‚Ä†identify problem areas and plan solutions. I had to extensively test my improvements to ensure backwards‚Ä† ‚Ä†compatibility and edge cases were accounted for.‚Ä† ‚Ä†I also added accessibility features such as dynamic text resizing based on monitor pixel density and user‚Ä† ‚Ä†input. I designed a user analytics and lesson tracking program which required me to design relational‚Ä† ‚Ä†database architecture. The analytics platform is a stand alone program that requires secure data exchange‚Ä† ‚Ä†between many different websites running different technology stacks. The administrators receive‚Ä† ‚Ä†comprehensive metrics on user activity providing them with the data they need to improve their program‚Ä† ‚Ä†and adapt to user√≠s needs. Web Developer/Systems Integrator South Town Arcade - San Francisco, CA September 2015 to September 2017 At SouthTown I had the opportunity to start my professional career as a web developer. I began my‚Ä† ‚Ä†employment as the business was building momentum and there were many challenges to overcome. For‚Ä† ‚Ä†example, they lacked an online system for keeping track of tournaments and player scores. I built a‚Ä† ‚Ä†Wordpress website that would allow them to stream live tournaments via the twitch API and record‚Ä† ‚Ä†tournament data to be displayed on their leader board.‚Ä† ‚Ä†Over time the tournaments grew and many customizations were required in order to keep track of tourney‚Ä† ‚Ä†brackets and game specific information. I also provided hardware integration and network support to‚Ä† ‚Ä†ensure a smooth experience for streaming tournaments. Using a combination of all my skills I developed a‚Ä† ‚Ä† web based system that was extremely easy for non technical users to work with. Working directly with the‚Ä† ‚Ä†business owners, I created an online registration process to allow people to sign up for tournaments. I also‚Ä† ‚Ä†managed the day to day updates and maintenance of their website including posting clips of highlights,‚Ä† ‚Ä†and information on tournament schedules.

Created reports in Oracle BI Publisher. Set-up schedule in Oracle DB. Web Developer ATA College, Inc November 2011 to July 2014 Web Form Development and maintenance using Visual Studio 2010 and SQL Server 2008R2. Duties involved maintenance of a CRM application using ASP.net, HTML, Javascript and VB.net. My duties included discussions with the users to determine requirements for system enhancements. Once requirements were established, I would create code and test the system, then review with the users to ensure accuracy, then promote the application into the production environment. This application made use of web services and several third party control libraries (Telerik Web Controls, ASPOSE for accessing MS Office objects, Crystal Reports for all reporting and SENTRY Document Management System).‚Ä† ‚Ä† Also maintained a Student Information Portal, also written in VB.Net and SQL Server, used by students to access grades and schedules. This Web Form demonstrated code reusability by accessing the web services and libraries of the CRM application.‚Ä† ‚Ä† Further, developed an On line Document Signing application in VB.net and the third party DocuSign system. This application enabled students to sign all necessary enrollment forms on line without the need to produce hard copies. The signed forms were then deposited in the aforementioned SENTRY Document Management System.‚Ä† ‚Ä† I was also the primary resource for information pertaining to any aspect of computer usage: MS Office, Software versioning and compatibility, on-line resources and application usage questions. Applications Consultant Humana January 2008 to April 2011 Web Development and maintenance utilizing Visual Studio 2005/2008, ASPX and C# with IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server databases. WebServices and WCF Services development with XML. Maintain Legacy Web screens using VB6 and Visual Interdev. Duties covered all aspects of SDLC: Analysis, Design, Development, Quality Control and Deployment.‚Ä† ‚Ä† Project Descriptions:‚Ä† 1) Product Database: The Product Database is an Enterprise-wide resource used to create Health Insurance Plans. The application is written in both Visual Studio 2005 (C#, ASPX.NET) and Visual Interdev (VB6, Classic ASP). Transitioning between the technologies is handled by the Interop capabilities of VS by coding the Navigation properties in the configuration file. The ASPX configuration involved Web Forms referencing a Master Page. Coding for the ASPX pages utilized the following architecture in C#: the Web Form controls fired events in the code behind which called functions in a Controller Class. The controller fired functions in a Manager class. The manager class handled the bulk of the processing code as well as the Data Access (DB2 Back end). Data Access was handled using the ActiveX objects (ODBC) built into VS. An interface was created pointing to the Manager object. This interface was used by a Client Server Class and a Client Server Proxy which fired a Web Service. This architecture enabled any other modules within the application to execute the manager class code by calling the Web Service. The Classic ASP pages contained VBScript, JAVAScript and HTML code. Most of the processing was handled in VB6 Modules compiled into a DLL and instantiated in the VBScript code. Data Access to the DB2 database was handled by coding SQL statements and using ADO Objects or by sending the SQL Statement to a Mainframe COBOL program using IBM Web Sphere message queue.‚Ä† 2) Product Catalog: The Product Catalog enabled users to query a Windows Communication Foundation service in the VS 2005/VB6 Product Database Application. Since VS 2005 does not support WCF Services, some specialized coding had to be implemented. A Proxy was written in VS2010 calling the actual service. This proxy was compiled into a DLL and this DLL then referenced by the VS2005 application. The service requests consisted of an XML String (built with the StringBuilder functions), based on parameters entered through a Web Form. The service response was parsed using the Document Object Model functionality. The VB6 code also had to call the service; this was accomplished by calling the C# Web Service created for the Product Catalog Web Form.‚Ä† 3) Product DataGrid: I was tasked with making significant changes to the Product DataGrid. This application was written entirely using VB6 WinForms. This application enabled users to query/set the limits and rules applicable to Product Types. Data access utilized ADO objects accessing both IBM DB2 and MS SQL Server backends.‚Ä† 4) Small Group/Large Group Plan Queries: These queries consisted of stand-alone Web Services that returned XML to satisfy Health Insurance Plan parameter requests. These requests were usually originated by Government Agencies‚Ä† ‚Ä† For all of these projects, I was responsible for:‚Ä† ‚Ä† √Ø Enabling local machine debugging by setting up Internet Information Service (IIS) properties‚Ä† √Ø Talking to the Business Users to get the requirements‚Ä† √Ø Documenting any necessary database changes‚Ä† √Ø Thoroughly testing the application in a test environment‚Ä† √Ø Promoting the Application to a Quality Assurance environment for Business User testing‚Ä† √Ø Promoting the application to a Production environment‚Ä† √Ø Generating any necessary documentation: Change Requests, Approvals Data Definitions, etc. Developer Commonwealth of Kentucky May 2007 to November 2007 Adapt WEB Portal (VB.Net and ASP.NET) for online queries.
